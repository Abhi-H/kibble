************************
Creating an Organisation
************************

The first thing you will need to set up, in order to use Kibble, is an
organisation that will contain the projects you wish to survey. You can
have multiple organisations in Kibble, and all organisations will be
scanned, but the UI will only display statistics for the current
(default) organisation you are using. You may switch between
organisations at your leisure in the UI.

To create your first organisation, go to the "Organisation" tab in the
top menu. In the `Create a new organisation` field set, you can then
create a new organisation by filling in the required data. This will
set up a new organisation and set it as your default (current) one.

Once an organisation has been created, you can then add resources and
users to it.
